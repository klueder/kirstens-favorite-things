### Approach to Building
I started this project with a very bare-bones site because while I knew I wanted to get some of the bigger challenges out of the way earlier, I also knew I needed a decent base to test any new features I wanted to add. I started by making the views for my home page and favorites pages, and the routes to go along with all of those, which felt pretty comfortable. Next came the fun steps of making my model and the routes and views it needs to perform all of it's functions! One of the things that helped me the most while doing these steps (and the whole project) was being able to rewatch the different lectures (or parts of them) as needed. Overall, I felt more confident than I thought I would while doing this project. There are also some little updates I can make as I have time to improve the site and I look forward to completing those (see notes below).
